Code samples for my application to the NCSS Summer School. Below are samples hosted elsewhere.

## Year 10 IST Website Design Assessment
An "educational" website created for an IST assessment task. Hosted [here](https://bababooey1234.github.io/), source code [here](https://github.com/bababooey1234/bababooey1234.github.io)

## 2022 Offseason Robotics Code
Code for the offseason robot of subteam 3 of 3132. (Technically I am a member of 5331, but 3132 and 5331 are basically one team). Will later be updated to add a sequence for the autonomous phase of the game. [https://github.com/Team3132/2022OffseasonTeam3](https://github.com/Team3132/2022OffseasonTeam3)
